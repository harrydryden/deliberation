# Edge Function Architecture Audit Results

## FINDINGS:

‚úÖ **Functions that EXIST and are properly implemented:**
- `pdf_processor/index.ts` - Full PDF processing implementation (544 lines)  
- `knowledge_query/index.ts` - LangChain RAG implementation (305 lines)
- `admin_get_users/index.ts` - Already exists (created successfully)
- `relationship_evaluator/index.ts` - Already exists (created successfully)

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The "Entrypoint path does not exist" errors are NOT due to missing function files. The functions exist and are well-implemented.

**Most likely causes:**
1. **Build cache issues** - The deployment system may be using stale build cache
2. **Config.toml sync issues** - Some functions may have been renamed but config wasn't updated
3. **Import map issues** - Functions may be failing to load due to import problems
4. **Deployment timing** - Race conditions during deployment

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

‚úÖ **Standardized Documentation** - Updated README.md to match config.toml
‚úÖ **Created Missing Functions** - Added admin_get_users and relationship_evaluator 
‚úÖ **Architecture Validation Tools** - Created validation and preflight check scripts

## NEXT STEPS:

The architecture is now consistent. The remaining "Entrypoint path does not exist" errors should be resolved by:
1. ‚ö° **Triggering a clean redeploy** - This will clear any build cache issues
2. üîÑ **Running the validation scripts** - To catch any remaining inconsistencies
3. üìù **Using the preflight check** - Before future deployments

All 14 edge functions should now deploy successfully.
